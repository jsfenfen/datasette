=======================
The Datasette Ecosystem
=======================

Datasette sits at the center of a growing ecosystem of open source tools aimed at making it as easy as possible to gather, analyze and publish interesting data.

These tools are divided into two main groups: tools for building SQLite databases (for use with Datasette) and plugins that extend Datasette's functionality.

Tools for creating SQLite databases
===================================

csvs-to-sqlite
--------------

`csvs-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite>`__ lets you take one or more CSV files and load them into a SQLite database. It can also extract repeated columns out into a separate table and configure SQLite full-text search against the contents of specific columns.

sqlite-utils
------------

`sqlite-utils <https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils>`__ is a Python library and CLI tool that provides shortcuts for loading data into SQLite. It can be used programmatically (e.g. in a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__) to load data, and will automatically create SQLite tables with the necessary schema.

The CLI tool can consume JSON streams directly and use them to create tables. It can also be used to query SQLite databases and output the results as CSV or JSON.

See `sqlite-utils: a Python library and CLI tool for building SQLite databases <https://simonwillison.net/2019/Feb/25/sqlite-utils/>`__ for more.

db-to-sqlite
------------

`db-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite>`__ is a CLI tool that builds on top of `SQLAlchemy <https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&q=sqlalchemy>`__ and allows you to connect to any database supported by that library (including MySQL, oracle and PostgreSQL), run a SQL query and save the results to a new table in a SQLite database. 

You can mirror an entire database (including copying foreign key relationships) with the ``--all`` option::

    $ db-to-sqlite --all "postgresql://simonw@localhost/myblog" blog.db

dbf-to-sqlite
-------------

`dbf-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/dbf-to-sqlite>`__ works with `dBase files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dbf>`__ such as those produced by Visual FoxPro. It is a command-line tool that can convert one or more ``.dbf`` file to tables in a SQLite database.

markdown-to-sqlite
------------------

`markdown-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/markdown-to-sqlite>`__ reads Markdown files with embedded YAML metadata (e.g. for `Jekyll Front Matter <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/>`__) and creates a SQLite table with a schema matching the metadata. This is useful if you want to keep structured data in text form in a GitHub repository and use that to build a SQLite database.

geojson-to-sqlite
-----------------

`geojson-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/geojson-to-sqlite>`__ converts GeoJSON files to SQLite, optionally using SpatiaLite to create geospatial indexes for fast geometric queries.

shapefile-to-sqlite
-------------------

`shapefile-to-sqlite <https://github.com/simonw/shapefile-to-sqlite>`__ converts ESRI shapefiles to SQLite, optionally using SpatiaLite .

socrata2sql
-----------

`socrata2sql <https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/socrata2sql>`__ is a tool by Andrew Chavez at the Dallas Morning News. It works with Socrata, a widely used platform for local and national government open data portals. It uses the Socrata API to pull down government datasets and store them in a local SQLite database (it can also export data to PostgreSQL, MySQL and other SQLAlchemy-supported databases).

For example, to create a SQLite database of the `City of Dallas Payment Register <https://www.dallasopendata.com/Budget-Finance/City-of-Dallas-Payment-Register/64pp-jeba>`__ you would run the following command::

    $ socrata2sql insert www.dallasopendata.com 64pp-jeba

datasette-haversine
-------------------

`datasette-haversine <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-haversine>`__ provides a SQL ``haversine()`` function which can calculate the haversine distance between two geographical points. You can then sort by this distance to find records closest to a specified location.

::

    select haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, 'mi');

datasette-sqlite-fts4
---------------------

`datasette-sqlite-fts4 <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-sqlite-fts4>`__ provides search relevance ranking algorithms that can be used with SQLite's FTS4 search module. You can read more about it in `Exploring search relevance algorithms with SQLite <https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-relevance-algorithms-sqlite/>`__.

datasette-bplist
----------------

`datasette-bplist <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-bplist>`__ provides tools for working with Apple's binary plist format embedded in SQLite database tables.

datasette-mask-columns
----------------------

`datasette-mask-columns <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-mask-columns>`__ allows you to use ``metadata.json`` to configure specific table columns that should be masked - that should return null no matter what value is contained within the column. This is useful for things like hiding ``password`` columns from public display.

datasette-auth-existing-cookies
-------------------------------

`datasette-auth-existing-cookies <https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-existing-cookies>`__ allows you to configure Datasette to authenticate users based on existing cookies they may have for the current domain - useful for running Datasette on a subdomain of your main site, for example.
